# File Descriptions

## ta_feature_dct.pkl

***ta_feature_dct.pkl***: This contains a dictionary which maps sites in San Francisco to their TripAdvisor tags.  (This should really be in some other file... will leave here for now.  Not even sure where this is used.  Seems to be redundant with ```loc_info.pkl``` living in ```preprocessing```.)

***style_mapper.pkl***:  This maps the tags used by TripAdvisor to the four preference labels we use.
